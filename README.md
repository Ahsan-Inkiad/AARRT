We have built a "Voting dApp (Decentralized Application)".

We have built our frontend using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Instead of connecting to  traditional backend server, our application was connected to a local Ethereum 
blockchain provided by "GANACHE". We have coded the logic of our dApp in an smart contract using Solidity programming language then we made a bridge between our backend 
and frontend via web3.js. After that, we have deployed our smart contract in our local Ethereum blockchain and thus our dApp was ready to be used.

*Blockchain     :  Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it 
                   difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is 
                   essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed 
                   across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. (We have used 
                   Ethereum blockchain).

*Smart contract :  A smart contract is code that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and runs 
                   exactly as programmed.

*Truffle        :  It is a Development Environment, Testing Framework and Asset pipeline for 
                   Ethereum Blockchain.

*Ganache        :  Ganache is a personal/local Ethereum Blockchain used to test smart 
                   contracts where you can deploy contracts, develop applications, run tests 
                   and perform other tasks without any cost.
*web3.js        :  It is a collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote 
                   Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or Web Socket.
